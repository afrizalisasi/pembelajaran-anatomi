### Section 4: Overview of the Cardiovascular System

### Learning Objectives:
1. Understand the functions of the cardiovascular system.
2. Describe the structure of the heart and blood vessels.
3. Explain the process of blood circulation.

### Introduction: 
The cardiovascular system, also known as the circulatory system, is responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products throughout the body. It consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood.

### Structure of the Heart: 
The heart is a muscular organ with four chambers:
1.	**Atria**: The upper chambers that receive blood returning to the heart.
2.	**Ventricles**: The lower chambers that pump blood out of the heart.

### Blood Vessels:
1.	**Arteries**: Carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the body's tissues.
2.	**Veins**: Transport deoxygenated blood from the body's tissues back to the heart.
3.	**Capillaries**: Microscopic vessels that facilitate the exchange of nutrients and waste products between blood and tissues.

### Blood Circulation:
1.	**Pulmonary Circulation**: Deoxygenated blood from the body flows to the right atrium and ventricle, then to the lungs to pick up oxygen.
2.	**Systemic Circulation**: Oxygenated blood is pumped from the left atrium and ventricle to the rest of the body's tissues.

### Heartbeat and Blood Flow: 
The heartbeat is regulated by electrical signals from the sinoatrial (SA) node, known as the heart's natural pacemaker. Blood is propelled through the heart's chambers and into blood vessels by rhythmic contractions.

### Cardiovascular System Functions: 
The cardiovascular system delivers oxygen and nutrients to cells, removes waste products, and helps regulate body temperature and hormone distribution.

### Summary: 
>The cardiovascular system transports essential substances throughout the body. The heart's four chambers and blood vessels play a vital role in systemic and pulmonary circulation. Blood flow is regulated by the heart's electrical system.

Individual Quiz:
1.	What is the main function of the cardiovascular system?
