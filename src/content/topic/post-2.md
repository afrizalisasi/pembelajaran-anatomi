### Section 2: Muscular System Overview

### Learning Objectives:

1. Understand the functions of the muscular system.
2. Differentiate between the types of muscle tissue.
3. Identify the major muscles of the body.

### Introduction:
The muscular system is responsible for movement, stability, and generating heat. It works in coordination with the skeletal system to produce various types of body movements.

### Types of Muscle Tissue:

1. **Skeletal Muscle**: Skeletal muscles are attached to bones and are under voluntary control. They enable body movement and provide strength. Examples include biceps and quadriceps.
2. **Smooth Muscle**: Smooth muscles are found in the walls of internal organs, such as the digestive tract and blood vessels. They facilitate involuntary movements.
3. **Cardiac Muscle**: Cardiac muscle is specific to the heart and contracts rhythmically to pump blood. It's involuntary and self-contracting.

### Major Muscles of the Body:

1. **Biceps Brachii**: Located in the upper arm, it flexes the forearm at the elbow.
2. **Quadriceps**: Group of four muscles in the front of the thigh that extend the knee joint.
3. **Gastrocnemius**: The calf muscle responsible for pointing the foot and flexing the knee.
4. **Deltoid**: Forms the shoulder muscle and allows arm abduction.
5. **Rectus Abdominis**: The "abs" muscle responsible for flexing the trunk.
6. **Trapezius**: Large muscle of the upper back and neck that moves and stabilizes the shoulder blades.

### Muscle Contraction:
Muscle contraction occurs through the sliding filament theory. Actin and myosin filaments within muscle fibers slide past each other, causing muscle fibers to shorten. This contraction is triggered by nerve impulses.

### Summary:
>The muscular system facilitates movement, stability, and heat generation. It consists of three types of muscle tissue: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. Major muscles of the body include the biceps, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, deltoid, rectus abdominis, and trapezius.

### Individual Quiz:

1. Which type of muscle is responsible for involuntary contractions in the walls of organs?
2. Name two major muscles of the upper body responsible for arm movement.
3. Explain the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction.
