### Section 3: Introduction to the Nervous System

### Learning Objectives:
1. Understand the functions of the nervous system.
2. Differentiate between the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.
3. Identify the basic components of a neuron.

### Introduction: 
The nervous system is a complex network of cells and fibers that transmit signals between different parts of the body. It's responsible for coordinating and controlling bodily functions.

### Nervous System Divisions:
1.	**Central Nervous System (CNS)**: The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord. It's responsible for processing and interpreting sensory information and generating responses.
2.	**Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**: The PNS connects the CNS to the rest of the body. It includes sensory and motor neurons that transmit information to and from the CNS.

### Neuron Structure: 
A neuron is the basic unit of the nervous system and has several components:
1.	**Cell Body (Soma)**: Contains the nucleus and essential cellular structures.
2.	**Dendrites**: Branched extensions that receive signals from other neurons and transmit them toward the cell body.
3.	**Axon**: Long fiber that transmits signals away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands.
4.	**Synapse**: The junction between two neurons where signals are transmitted using neurotransmitters.

### Types of Neurons:
1.	**Sensory Neurons**: Transmit sensory information from sensory organs to the CNS.
2.	**Motor Neurons**: Carry signals from the CNS to muscles and glands, controlling their activity.
3.	**Interneurons**: Found within the CNS, they process and transmit signals between sensory and motor neurons.

### Nervous System Function: 
The nervous system controls voluntary and involuntary actions, processes sensory information, and plays a crucial role in cognition and consciousness.

### Summary: 
>The nervous system serves as the body's communication network. It's divided into the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). Neurons are the fundamental units of the nervous system, transmitting signals through their components. Types of neurons include sensory, motor, and interneurons.

### Individual Quiz:
1.	What are the two main divisions of the nervous system?
2.	Which part of a neuron transmits signals away from the cell body?
3.	Describe the role of sensory neurons.
